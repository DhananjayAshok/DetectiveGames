Add the Clue prefab to the scene
Change the physical representation to whatever you want but
	ensure it has a collider (not a trigger collider) and a no rigidbody
	Make sure to set the tag of this physical rep to a clue
	If you cant interact with objects when you try this is why
Go to clue script of the clue object and change the clue string
Also change the clue image to a sprite of your choosing
	To create a unity sprite you must import an image and then in the inspector make sure texture type is sprite

1. Drag in a suspect prefab object into scene view. Go to suspect name text and fill in the textMesh text field to give them a name and you can customize color too.
2. Under body create a physical rep with a collider. Give this body a tag of suspect
	Mixamo has nice ones online
3. Set the isGuilty bool as required
4. Then go to the scene specific folder and in the folder of your scene make a script 
	This script should inherit from TreeCreationScript
	You need to define a 
	public override void CreateTree(){
	}
	Inside this do whatever you want but make sure by the end the baseTree variable is set to a valid Conversation Tree

5. Finally drag the script and apply it to the suspect you want to have this conversation tree. 

Hints:
In the CreateTree functions you can use the utility function
	CTFL that takes in an integer index and returns a CT as defined in the parent class. 
	The baseTree.addChild(subtree) function can be used to add children to any tree.	
		If you try adding more than 4 children it does nothing.

See the Make a 3rd person to do for how to import Mixamo characters

6. To give animations 
	Go to the physical rep and give the object an animator component
	Select a controller and pick one from the default options given
	
	Select the avatar that either matches the body fbx model if there is already such an avatar or the avatar with the same name as the controller	
	Dead bodies can be animated in this way too so if you want to make dead body clues this is it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instead of doing step 4 and 5 you could just also use one of the base tree structures scripts
	This is more convinient but limits the shape and size of your tree
